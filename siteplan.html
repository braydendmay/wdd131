    <header>Arcadia Games-title[header]</header>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to show users the games a arcade store has, how much each costs to use and questions that they may have.</p>
    <p>How much does it cost to run a game of pac man each time?</p>
    <p>which game has the hightest score?</p>
    <p>I will use dark blue[navy] for the header and footer, and then i will use a green for text background.</p>
